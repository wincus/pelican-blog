Summary: How I solved my public transportation credit problems ...
 from command line

Being myself an absentminded kinda person, I always forget to buy credit
in order to use the public transportation.

Consequences
------------
It's not a happy moment when I'm already on board and I notice that I ran out
 of credit. Two options are usually available. Asking somebody to pay for me, 
which is uncomfortable, or walk, which is worst.

The Solution
------------
It's Really Simple. I'm always working in a command line terminal, so I wrote 
[this](https://github.com/wincus/redbus-byobu-status) little web-scrapping i
script that shows my credit status on byobu's status line. 

Thanks for passing by!
