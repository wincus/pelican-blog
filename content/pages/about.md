Summary: This is me

hi there! you are reading my personal blog.

I'm passionate about GNU/Linux server side components, computer networks,
sysadmin day work challenges, command line interfaces, automation and
orchestation. I'm also an Electronic Engineer and a computer network
University Professor. Last but not least I'm a guitar player and a music
lover.

Thanks for passing by!
