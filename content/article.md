Summary: My blog components

This blog is written in [vim](http://vim.org), generated by
[pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) using [python](http://python.org),
content controlled by [git](http://git-scm.com), and free hosted by
[github](http://github.com) personal web pages.

Amazing tools that put together just another boring [Blog](http://blog.wincus
.com.ar).

By the way, you can find the pelican source pages that generate this blog
[here](https://github.com/wincus/pelican-blog).

Thanks for passing by!
